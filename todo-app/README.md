# 📝 React Todo App with TailwindCSS

This project is a simple, yet functional Todo List application built using **React** and styled with **TailwindCSS**. It supports creating, completing, deleting, and filtering tasks — all while saving the task list locally using `localStorage`.

## 💡 What I Did

- Set up a fresh React project using Vite.
- Installed and configured **TailwindCSS** for fast, modern styling.
- Built a clean and minimal **Todo App** with React hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`.
- Added functionality for:
  - Adding new tasks
  - Toggling tasks as complete/incomplete
  - Filtering tasks (All / Active / Completed)
  - Persisting tasks in `localStorage`
- Created a simple and responsive UI without overcomplicating the design.
